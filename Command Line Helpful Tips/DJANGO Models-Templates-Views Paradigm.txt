Models-Templates-Views Paradigm

- Django operates on what is known as (M-T-V)s!
- Working with Django encompases understanding how these are connected

STEPS
1 - Import any models we need to use into views.py file
2 - Use the view to query the model we require data from
3 - Pass results from model to template
4 - Pre-define template ready to except & display data from our model
5 - Map URK to View
