Creating New View (Tips) Existing Django Project

____.html file
- Create a new html file at the app level that will output our desired task/s
- Remember to using template tagging to input any details from ex. base level html file

views.py file
- Define a new function that will pull data from our models.py file and execute the task required
- Hook this up to our function ex:

  def new_view(request):
      return (request, 'app_name/(html file created), {})
  
  NOTE
  - Empty dictionary added to retrun function as we continue to build out new view. This will change later to output desried models.py file data (render)
   onto assigned hmtl.file 
  
urls.py file
- import the new view
- add this view to URL patterns

These are the first steps in the case when already have app and other views created in our Django project. Above enables us to hook up our (Models | Templates | Views) up for the required tasks/s intial steps.
